Dog Dashboard

This project is a Flutter app that allows users to fetch and display images of dogs from the Dog CEO API. The app has the following features:

Users can fetch a random dog by breed, all dogs of a particular breed, or a random dog by breed and sub-breed.
The app displays the dog images in a list or grid view.
Users can click on a dog image to view it in full screen.
The app is built using the following technologies:

Flutter
Provider
Dog CEO API
You can use this app to learn about different dog breeds and to see cute pictures of dogs.

Here are some ideas for how you can improve the app:

Add the ability to save and share dog images.
Add a search function so that users can easily find specific dog breeds.
Add the ability to filter the dog images by breed, size, or color.
Add a quiz feature where users can try to identify different dog breeds.
I hope this is helpful!
